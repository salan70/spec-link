# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A documentation hub, matching Japanese task guides, and the read-only
  `just check-docs` structural gate provide a maintained path through user,
  integration, specification, and contributor documentation.

### Changed

- Packaged user documentation is consolidated into six task-oriented names:
  `getting-started`, `configuration`, `linking`, `commands`, `automation`, and
  `troubleshooting`.

### Deprecated

- `docbridge docs show annotations`, `linking-workflow`, and `link-review` now
  resolve to `linking`, while `agent-integration` resolves to `automation`.
  These hidden compatibility names warn on stderr and will be removed in
  v0.10.0.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- The VS Code-compatible extension `salan70.docbridge` is published on Visual
  Studio Marketplace.
- Packaged user docs now cover linking workflow and semantic link review
  (`docbridge docs show linking-workflow`, `docbridge docs show link-review`),
  plus supported and unsupported `@doc` declaration forms, the heading-anchor
  algorithm, and named link-authoring diagnostic codes.
- Human-readable `docbridge check` output ends with a pointer to
  `docbridge docs show troubleshooting`. `check --json` is unchanged.

### Changed

- `docbridge init` and `docbridge init-with-agent` install one skill,
  `docbridge`, instead of the five companion skills. The skill routes adopt,
  discover-and-link, annotate, review, and sync work; facts about the binary
  come from `docbridge docs show`.

### Fixed

- `just package-vsix` bundles `vscode-languageclient` into the editor client.
  Packaging with `--no-dependencies` previously omitted the module, so the
  installed VSIX failed to activate.
- `docs/user/annotations.md` no longer claims GitHub-style numeric suffixes for
  duplicate headings. Duplicate anchors in one file are `duplicate_doc_anchor`.

### Upgrading

- Existing installs keep the five legacy skill directories
  (`docbridge-adopt`, `docbridge-annotate`, `docbridge-link`,
  `docbridge-review`, `docbridge-sync`) until `docbridge init --force` is run.
  Review locally edited copies first. Symlinked skill directories are reported
  and left untouched.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Rust is a first-party code language. Configure `include.code.rust`, place
  `@doc` in `///` / `//!` / `/** */` comments on modules, structs, enums, free
  functions, and inherent `impl` methods, and check links with the bundled
  `docbridge-rust-scanner` worker (same platforms as Swift/Dart). Default
  visibility is `pub` only; set `visibility` to include `private` for
  non-`pub` items. Canonical IDs use Rust path style (`Type::method`).
- `docbridge docs list [--json]` and `docbridge docs show <name>` provide six
  task-oriented, version-matched guides from the installed npm package, with
  packed-package smoke coverage under Node.js and Bun.
- CLI invocation errors now list valid commands, suggest close command names,
  and include runnable command-specific recovery guidance. Missing check
  configuration also points to `docbridge init` and `docbridge init-with-agent`.
- TypeScript type members can be link endpoints, closing the last functional
  asymmetry with Swift and Dart. `@doc` on a class method, property, getter,
  setter, constructor, or static member, on an interface member, or on a member
  of a type alias written directly as an object type literal resolves to a
  type-qualified endpoint such as `AuthService.login`. Canonical IDs carry no
  parameter signatures: overload groups and getter/setter pairs each describe
  one member and collapse to one endpoint, and a collision — including a static
  and an instance member of the same name — reports `duplicate_code_symbol`.
  Only identifier-named members qualify, because a link target is
  `file#fragment` with one `#` and no whitespace.
- `include.code.typescript.visibility` accepts `public`, `protected`, and
  `private`, defaulting to `public` and `protected`. It scopes type members
  only; top-level declarations remain scoped by `export`.

### Changed

- Scanner worker request and response payloads now have a published JSON Schema,
  and malformed nested worker output fails explicitly instead of degrading into
  incomplete scan data. Graph and context output schemas share their diagnostic
  definitions and are checked against real CLI output. The configuration schema
  now matches the CLI's per-language suffix and visibility rules.
- `docbridge context` and `docbridge graph --include-content` strip the common
  leading indentation from an extracted declaration, so a type member reads at
  its own level. Output for top-level declarations is unchanged.
- A `@doc` on a TypeScript type member was previously collected by nothing and
  silently ignored. It is now a real annotation, so an existing one can surface
  link diagnostics — `invalid_link_target`, `doc_file_not_found`,
  `doc_anchor_not_found`, `doc_backlink_not_found` — that were always latent,
  and an annotation on a `private` member becomes `unsupported_declaration`.
  `check --audit` output is unchanged: members never count as
  `undocumented_symbol`.
- `docbridge check --audit` reports `unlinked_doc_section`, a warning for
  in-scope documentation sections that carry no `@code` annotation. It is the
  documentation-side counterpart to `undocumented_symbol`, so the audit now
  covers both directions of the link graph. Reporting is rolled up over the
  heading tree: only the topmost heading of a fully unannotated subtree is
  reported, and a heading is treated as annotated whenever a `@code` comment is
  attached to it, even if that annotation fails to parse or resolve. Empty
  headings create no anchor and are never reported, but they still close the
  section before them, so a deeper heading following one is a separate region
  rather than a suppressed descendant. Runs
  without `--audit` are unaffected, and the diagnostic is a warning, so exit
  codes do not change.

### Fixed

- Swift and Dart scanners now report malformed and duplicate `@doc` targets as
  `invalid_link_target` and `duplicate_link`, matching TypeScript instead of
  silently accepting or discarding the annotations.
- `docbridge graph --include-content` no longer truncates a signature at an
  object type. It cut the rendered text at the first `{`, which for
  `login(options: { verbose: boolean })` produced `login(options: {}`. A
  `signatureRange` already ends where the implementation body begins in every
  language, so no body has to be cut out of it.
- The VS Code extension manifest is version-aligned with the npm package again
  (`0.4.1` had drifted from `0.6.1`), so a checkout of `main` is a valid input
  to `just package-vsix`. Release Prepare now bumps both manifests through
  `scripts/set-release-version.ts` and stages both in the release commit, so a
  CLI release can no longer leave the extension version behind.
- `just package-vsix` bundles the server the VSIX ships with `--target node`,
  matching the npm build. The Bun-targeted bundle it built before still carried
  a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang and crashed with `__require is not a function`
  when the packaging flow's own `verify-dist` step executed it.

### Removed

- The agent-hook integration is gone from the product surface: the copyable
  scripts under `examples/hooks/` and the hook recipes in
  `docs/integrations/claude-code.md` and `docs/integrations/codex.md` no longer
  ship. Wiring DocBridge into an agent's `PostToolUse`/`Stop` hooks covered only
  the agents that read those configuration files; the documented guardrail is
  now a Git `pre-commit` hook, which applies to every contributor and every
  tool. Both integration documents survive as skill-installation guides,
  `docbridge context` and `docbridge related --gate` are unchanged, and
  `docbridge docs show agent-integration` describes the Git-hook shape instead.
  Copies already installed in adopters' repositories keep working.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- The related-gate CI recipe in `docs/integrations/ci.md` now derives the PR
  changed-file list from the checkout (`git diff BASE...HEAD` with
  `fetch-depth: 0`) and falls back to a retried GitHub API call. Outcomes are
  reported as `clean`, `violation`, or `infra-error`, and the sticky comment
  updates on every outcome (including infrastructure failure). Adopters who
  copied the previous recipe must re-copy it and set `fetch-depth: 0` on the
  checkout step; a shallow checkout breaks the new primary path.
- Shipped Swift and Dart scanner executables are now named
  `docbridge-swift-scanner` and `docbridge_dart_scanner`. Paths under
  `dist/bin/<platform>/speclink-*` no longer exist; delete `chmod +x`
  workarounds that hard-coded those names rather than updating the paths.

### Fixed

- Bundled Swift and Dart scanner binaries no longer have to be executable at
  install time. Installers do not reliably preserve the executable bit on files
  under `dist/bin/`, which made `docbridge check` fail on every Swift or Dart
  project; DocBridge now restores the bit on its own bundled scanners when the
  current process cannot execute them. Consumers can remove `chmod +x`
  workarounds from their build recipes. When the bit cannot be restored, or when
  the binary is executable but the filesystem refuses to execute it as a
  `noexec` mount does, `code_scanner_unavailable` now names the cause and the
  remedy instead of surfacing a bare spawn error.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- The npm package now runs on Node.js (>= 22) in addition to Bun: the CLI is
  built for the Node target with a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang, so
  `npx docbridge` works without installing Bun. Packaging smoke tests exercise
  the CLI under both runtimes.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Linux x64 release packages now build the Dart scanner with the official Dart
  SDK on Ubuntu 22.04, avoiding Nix store paths and newer glibc requirements
  that made the scanner unavailable on plain Linux hosts.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-12

### Removed

- Removed Open VSX from the editor delivery scope and deleted its unused manual
  publishing command; the supported registry target is VS Code Marketplace.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- VS Code-compatible extension packaging and manual publishing support:
  release VSIX generation, VSIX verification, Marketplace/Open VSX publish
  commands, Swift/Dart document activation, and bundled `docbridge lsp`
  startup from the extension package.

### Fixed

- The release publish workflow now restores executable bits on downloaded
  Swift and Dart scanner artifacts before packing the npm tarball, and
  smoke-tests the installed tarball before publishing.

### Changed

- Clarified the current editor delivery state in the English and Japanese
  READMEs, including local VSIX installation and the remaining first-publication
  work for VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- `docbridge init` for CLI-driven first-time setup: repository scope discovery,
  safe `docbridge.config.json` creation, and DocBridge agent skill installation.
- `docbridge init-with-agent` for agent-guided adoption: installs
  `docbridge-adopt` and prints one-shot setup commands without launching an
  agent process.
- `docbridge-adopt` now installs the companion DocBridge skills after adoption
  scope is confirmed.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- npm distribution support for the Bun-only `docbridge` package, including
  `dist/index.js` as the package binary, a runtime package allowlist, dist
  verification, packed-package smoke testing, and release workflow publishing.
- Platform-staged Swift and Dart scanner binary layout under
  `dist/bin/<platform>/`, with initial npm scanner support for `darwin-arm64`
  and `linux-x64`.
- Dart scanner worker support, including analyzer-based `@doc` extraction,
  type/member canonical IDs (without parameter signatures, since Dart has no
  overloading), public-by-naming visibility, and Dart end-to-end
  check/context/graph/LSP integration. The Dart toolchain is provided by the Nix
  dev shell.
- Swift scanner worker support for SwiftPM source checkouts, including
  SwiftSyntax-based `@doc` extraction, type/member canonical IDs, visibility
  filtering, and Swift end-to-end check/context/graph/LSP integration.
- Worker-backed scanner protocol foundation for Swift and Dart adapters,
  including stdin/stdout JSON invocation and scanner availability/failure
  diagnostics.
- `docbridge graph`: prints the resolved link graph as human-readable output or
  as JSON following `schemas/graph-output.schema.json`, including resolvable
  one-way links, pair completeness, optional lightweight node content, and
  diagnostics that do not prevent graph construction.
- Distributable adoption skills under `templates/skills/`: `docbridge-adopt`
  for existing-project setup, `docbridge-link` for docs-first annotation
  candidate confirmation, and `docbridge-review` for whole-graph semantic
  review using `docbridge graph --json --include-content`.

### Changed

- The project, package, command, configuration file, templates, and repository
  URLs were renamed from SpecLink/`speclink` to DocBridge/`docbridge`.
- `docbridge context` and `docbridge graph --json` now carry code language
  metadata for code blocks/nodes so Swift endpoints render and serialize as
  Swift.
- DocBridge's distributable skills are now dogfooded from `.agents/skills/` and
  `.claude/skills/` as symlinks to the canonical `templates/skills/` entries.
- TypeScript scanner endpoints now include `signatureRange` in addition to the
  existing full `declarationRange`, allowing graph consumers to read the
  public JSDoc/signature surface without implementation bodies.

### Fixed

- Worker-backed scanner responses now fail when the returned file list does not
  exactly match the requested files, and worker failures suppress derived link
  diagnostics for the failed file.
- The npm-distributed CLI now resolves its bundled `dist/bin/<platform>` Swift
  and Dart scanner binaries when launched through the `node_modules/.bin`
  symlink, which previously resolved to the wrong directory on Linux and
  reported the scanner as unavailable.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `speclink context`: prints the content of the counterparts linked from a set
  of input files (positional arguments or newline-separated stdin via
  `--stdin`) — full Markdown sections for doc counterparts, full declarations
  including JSDoc for code counterparts. Default output is Markdown suitable
  for direct injection into an agent prompt; `--json` emits a machine-readable
  report following `schemas/context-output.schema.json`. Extraction is
  best-effort: check diagnostics located in the input files are reported on
  stderr (or in the `diagnostics` field) without affecting the exit code.
- TypeScript scanner: records a `declarationRange` covering each supported
  declaration including its JSDoc block, backing `context` content extraction.
- `just context`: prints the linked counterpart content of the uncommitted
  changes.
- AI integration recipes under `docs/integrations/`: on-edit counterpart
  awareness and gate triage for Claude Code and Codex, and a CI recipe for
  gating the PR change set and reporting counterpart content.
- Copyable agent hook scripts under `examples/hooks/`: a `PostToolUse` hook
  that surfaces linked counterpart content on edit, and a `Stop` hook that
  reports `related --gate` findings with the flagged counterparts' content as
  Stop `additionalContext`.
- Distributable agent skills under `templates/skills/`: `speclink-annotate`
  (create `@doc`/`@code` link pairs and verify them with `speclink check`) and
  `speclink-sync` (triage `related --gate` findings using `speclink context`).
  Both are also installed in this repository's `.claude/skills/`.

### Changed

- Markdown section extraction moved from the LSP layer into `src/core/` and is
  now shared by LSP hover and `speclink context` (no behavior change).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `speclink related`: an informational command that lists the linked
  counterparts of a set of changed files (positional arguments or
  newline-separated stdin via `--stdin`), marking whether each counterpart is
  itself in the change set. Designed to sit behind `git diff --name-only` in
  pre-commit hooks and CI. Supports `--root` and `--json`; always exits `0` on
  success.
- `speclink related --gate`: a gate mode that reports only the counterparts
  that are not themselves in the change set and exits `1` when any exist. The
  check is symmetric (changed code with unchanged linked docs, and changed
  docs with unchanged linked code). Combines with `--json` for a
  machine-readable violations report.
- `speclink lsp`: a Language Server over stdio that exposes the SpecLink link
  graph to editors, with JSON-RPC `Content-Length` framing and the standard
  `initialize` / `initialized` / `shutdown` / `exit` lifecycle.
- `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`: the existing v0.1 diagnostics surfaced in
  the editor, refreshed on document changes with a short debounce.
- `textDocument/hover`: inline Markdown spec sections for linked code symbols,
  and the declaration signature line for linked headings.
- `textDocument/definition` and `textDocument/references` over the symmetric
  counterpart relation, including one-to-many navigation.
- Scanner range enrichment (`nameRange`, `headingTextRange`, `targetRange`) and
  a whole-project model with buffer overlay backing the language server.
- A minimal VS Code client extension under `editors/vscode/` to verify the
  server in a real editor.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

Initial release of the SpecLink CLI.

### Added

- `@doc` annotation parsing from TypeScript JSDoc via the TypeScript Compiler API.
- `@code` annotation parsing from Markdown HTML comments.
- Markdown scanner with v0.1 heading anchor generation.
- Configuration loading (`speclink.config.json`) with `*`/`**` glob scanning.
- Bidirectional link resolution between code and documentation.
- Deterministic, machine-readable diagnostics.
- `speclink check` command with `--root`, `--json`, and `--audit` options.
- `speclink --version` (alias `-v`) and `speclink --help` (alias `-h`).
