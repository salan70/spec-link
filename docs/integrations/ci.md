# CI integration

How to run the DocBridge gate in CI so the pull request — not the agent
session — is the enforcement point for linked counterparts.

A local Git `pre-commit` hook (see
[automation guide](../user/automation.md)) is informational by design:
it raises awareness while the work is in progress but never blocks, and it sees
only one commit's staged files. CI re-runs the same gate over the whole PR
change set, and the human merge approval enforces the outcome.

## Validate the link graph

Run the checker as a required status check:

```yaml
- name: DocBridge check
  run: docbridge check
```

`docbridge check` exits `1` on any error diagnostic, so a broken link fails the
job. Add `--json` when a later step consumes the diagnostics.

## Gate the PR change set

Run `docbridge related --gate` over the files the PR changes and report the
result as one of three outcomes: `clean`, `violation`, or `infra-error`.

Derive the changed-file list from the checkout with
`git diff --name-only "${BASE_SHA}...${HEAD_SHA}"` (three-dot form against the
event payload SHAs). Fall back to a retried `gh api .../pulls/<n>/files` call
only when the checkout-local path fails its guards. The checkout step must use
`fetch-depth: 0`: a shallow checkout is the one configuration that breaks this
recipe, because `git diff` then errors or yields an empty list.

This repository's [`ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
(`related-gate-report` job) is the same recipe with the `docbridge` command
prefix replaced by `nix develop -c bun run src/cli/index.ts`.

````yaml
# fetch-depth: 0 is required: the primary changed-file derivation is
# `git diff BASE_SHA...HEAD_SHA`, which needs both commit objects. A
# shallow checkout is the one configuration that breaks this recipe.

The gate exits `1` when a changed file has a linked counterpart that the PR
does not also change. A violation does not necessarily mean the counterpart
must change; it means nobody has decided yet. Two reporting styles:

- **Informational (recommended)** — set `continue-on-error: true` on the job so
  a `violation` or `infra-error` does not block merge, and post the outcome as
  a sticky PR comment (`if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` so an infrastructure failure
  overwrites a prior success, while a cancelled superseded run stays silent).
  The three outcomes are distinguishable from the comment alone.
- **Blocking** — make the job required, forcing every PR to either update
  counterparts or carve them out of the gate. Only adopt this once the link
  graph is dense enough that violations are rare; with a sparse graph it
  mostly trains people to bypass the check. Prefer leaving `infra-error`
  distinguishable even when blocking violations.

## Attach counterpart content to the report

To let the reviewer judge divergence without opening files, enrich the gate
report with the flagged counterparts' content:

```sh
docbridge context --stdin --json < changed-files.txt > context.json
```

Filter the `contexts` array to the endpoints reported as gate violations
(`related --gate --json`, field `counterpartEndpoint`) and append each block's
`content` to the comment body. The JSON shape is specified by
[`schemas/context-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/context-output.schema.json);
[`scripts/related-gate-report.ts`](../../scripts/related-gate-report.ts) shows
the same filtering as the DocBridge repository's own `pre-commit` report.

| `docbridge related --gate` | no violations     | at least one violation               |
| `docbridge context`        | always on success | invocation/configuration errors only |
